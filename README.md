In this tutorial, we will guide you step by step through the process of writing experiment specifications using our custom **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**. You will also learn how to run these specifications on the **Experimentation Engine**. The tutorial is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to define experiments using the DSL and leverage the Experimentation Engine to execute them efficiently.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Write clear and effective experiment specifications.
- Understand key elements and syntax of the DSL.
- Run and monitor experiments on the Experimentation Engine.

Let's get started!
